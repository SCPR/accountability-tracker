Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local government: Colleges and universities would face new constraints on their ability to raise additional revenue in the form of student fees and tuition in a given year. While continuing students in good academic standing would experience stable tuition and fee levels, tuition charged to new students at the University of California and the California State University could be higher than it would otherwise be, especially in the initial years after the initiative's adoption. The state could face General Fund cost pressures to the extent that universities were not able to raise the tuition revenue they would otherwise seek. This pressure would likely diminish over time as additional students became subject to the increased tuition levels. At the California Community Colleges, General Fund pressure likely would be minor, even initially.","http://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2788&context=ca_ballot_inits","Christopher J.

Potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in net additional tax revenues related to the production and sale of marijuana products.","http://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2692&context=ca_ballot_inits","James P.

Initiative Constitutional Amendment.","Sets retirement age at 62 for persons who are or will be public employees. Limits pensions to 60 percent of employee's highest average base wage for three consecutive years. Requires employees match public agency pension contribution. Mandates public employees work fulltime for five consecutive years to receive pension. Provides public agency full discretion to modify pensions, and prevents pension changes through contract or collective bargaining. Retains current pension benefits for legislators and public employees retiring before initiative is effective.  Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local government: Major reductions in state and local defined benefit pension contributions -- potentially totaling billions of dollars per year (as measured in today's dollars) -- over the long run. These reductions would be offset to an unknown extent by increases in other compensation costs for some public employees, depending on labor market conditions and future decisions made by governmental entities.","http://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2686&context=ca_ballot_inits","Roger Niello c/o Thomas W.

INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.","Changes method of calculating minimum funding level for K-12 public schools. Eliminates constitutional guarantee of state funding of community colleges. Changes method of calculating state spending limit. Subjects certain transportation and other currently excluded expenditures to spending limit. Eliminates constitutional requirement that revenues received in excess of spending limit be returned to taxpayers and used for schools, and generally redirects those revenues toward reducing state debt. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local government: Revised spending limit likely would alter state spending. In the near future, the percentage of the state budget devoted to debt expenses likely would increase, and the percentage devoted to most other areas likely would decrease. Over the longer term, state reserves, tax rebates, and other one-time spending also could increase. Possible state funding decreases for community college districts, given this measure's elimination of their constitutional funding guarantee. Possible increase or decrease in state funding for K-12 school districts in any given year, given this measure’s changes of their constitutional funding guarantee.","http://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2642&context=ca_ballot_inits","Thomas W.

For all public employees this measure: prohibits retroactive increases in retirement benefits; requires public employers to make annual payments to fund future benefit costs; and allows public employers to adjust retirement contribution rates in future labor agreements. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local government: Major reductions in annual pension contribution costs for employees hired on or after July 1, 2009, offset to an unknown extent by increases in costs for other forms of public employee compensation. Major short-term increase in annual governmental payments to prefund retiree health benefits, more than offset in the long run by annual reductions in these costs. (Initiative 07-0024.)

Initiative Statute.","Revises “Three Strikes” law by providing generally that offenders with two or more prior serious and/or violent felony convictions whose current offense is a non-serious and/or non-violent felony be sentenced to twice the usual term for the current offense, instead of 25 years to life. Authorizes re-sentencing of persons serving indeterminate life sentences where the offense was non-serious and non-violent. Eligibility for shorter sentences or re-sentencing would not apply to specified crimes, including murder, firearm use, and certain sex or drug offenses. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: Net state savings—primarily to prison operations—potentially in the tens of millions of dollars initially, increasing to about one hundred million dollars annually within a decade. Unknown state savings for capital outlay associated with prison construction that would otherwise be needed, potentially as much as several hundreds of millions of dollars in the long term. Increased county costs of potentially several millions of dollars initially, decreasing significantly in subsequent years, for jail and court-related costs.

Half of the Fund will be used to pay for all admission and student related fees for all California residents at California public colleges. The other half of the Fund will go to the California Superintendent of Public Instruction to create college-bound programs for poor children. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: If passed, there would be an annual increase in retail sales taxes of about 6 billion dollars to be used for higher education and social services programs.

Provides annual state-funded tax-free grants of $3,000 or $3,200 per child to parents of children in non-public schooling, including private and parochial schools and non-traditional programs, who pass applicable grade-level examination. Offers bi-monthly examinations to confirm grant eligibility. Authorizes state loans to eligible grant recipients. Establishes mandatory annual grade-level examinations for public school grades 1-12 to assess skills in English, mathematics, geography, physical science, history, civics. Passing score required for most public school pupils before advancement to next grade. Requires performance reports. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: This measure would result in significant annual costs to the State to provide grants to non-public school pupils, to administer the testing and reporting system, and to reimburse local school districts for state-mandated costs associated with testing and reporting. The measure would also result in some offsetting savings from students leaving the public school system. The measure's net fiscal impact on the State would ultimately depend in large part on how people respond to its provisions. For example: (a) if the measure results in only a slight increase in the number of students repeating grades but has a significant impact on the number of students leaving public schools, it could result in net costs of up to several hundreds of millions of dollars annually in later years under the measure; or (b) alternatively, if the measure significantly increases the number of students repeating grades and has a smaller effect on public school students leaving public schools, it could result in net later year costs in the billions of dollars annually.","http://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1992&context=ca_ballot_inits","David Barulich Committee To End Social Promotion, 1041 Rutland Avenue, Los Angeles, Ca 90042","","(323) 257-1827","1/15/1999","Initiative","Failed to Qualify","Education.

Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: This measure would result in a major rearrangement of the State's system of school finance, with growing annual savings in public school expenditures and growing annual costs of a new system of grants for children transferring to, or already attending, private schools. Initial fiscal impact ranging from annual costs of over $150 million to over $600 million. Long-run fiscal impact ranging from net annual costs of over $500 million to net annual savings of around $2.5 billion.

Provides exception when an uninsured motorist is injured by a subsequently convicted drunk driver. With this one exception, provides that insurer is not liable for noneconomic damages. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: Reduction in these types of lawsuits could decrease court-related costs to state and local governments and payments to these plaintiffs. The savings would probably be minor. Possible decrease in gross premiums tax revenue to the state through somewhat lower premiums for liability coverage. This revenue loss would probably be less than $5 million annually and would result in a corresponding reduction in state school spending of about half of the loss.","http://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1852&context=ca_ballot_inits","Chuck Quackenbush C/O: Charles H.

Declares that the official position of the People of the State of California is that its elected officials should vote to help enact an amendment to the U.S. Constitution limiting congressional terms.

Requires the California Legislature and state and federal legislators from California to use their powers to pass the amendment. All candidates for federal or state legislative office who do not provide required support must be identified as non-supporters on ballot. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: This measure would have unknown, but possibly significant, annual costs for the Secretary of State's review activities. The costs could range from the tens of thousands to possibly several hundreds of thousands of dollars to review candidate filing papers and develop a system for tracking incumbent legislators' (both federal and state) voting records on term limits.

The state also would likely incur major one-time capital outlay costs for construction of additional prison space of at least $85 million within five years and probably will exceed $335 million within 25 years of enactment. Major costs to the criminal justice system are likely, probably amounting to at least several million dollars annually.

Amends Constitution to allow Governor to declare ""fiscal emergency"" when budget not adopted or projected deficit exceeds specified percentages. Grants Governor, with certain restrictions, powers to reduce expenditures to balance budget including reducing state employee salaries or ordering furloughs. Amends statutes to eliminate or limit cost of living adjustments in AFDC, SSI/SSP, and IHSS welfare programs. Reduces AFDC rates by 10%, then 15% after six months. Limits aid for new residents. Provides school attendance incentives. Gives counties discretion to set general assistance. Implements as federal law permits. Contains other provisions. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local government: The budgetary provisions could result in net state savings or costs of up to hundreds of millions or billions of dollars annually depending on future actions by the Governor and the Legislature. The fiscal effects of the welfare provisions would depend on a variety of factors such as caseload, inflation, and government actions. However, assuming federal waivers are obtained, the following cost and savings would result: (1) State government would obtain net savings of probably less than $680 million in 1993-94, primarily due to the reduction in AFDC maximum aid payments (MAP). These savings would increase annually. Beginning in 1996-97, additional savings, potentially several hundred million dollars, would result due to elimination of statutory cost of living adjustments (COLAs) for AFDC and SSI/SSP. Such savings would increase by comparable amounts annually. Actual savings would depend on inflation and whether such COLAs would be provided without a statutory requirement. (2) Counties would obtain net savings potentially up to about $70 million in 1993-94, primarily due to MAP reductions, elimination of IHSS COLAs, and limitation of general assistance grants. These savings would grow due to the increasing effect of the maximum grant provision and, beginning in 1996-97, elimination of the statutory AFDC COLA. Additionally, unknown annual savings, potentially in the hundreds of millions of dollars, could result if counties significantly reduced general assistance grants.","http://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1726&context=ca_ballot_inits","Pete Wilson, 1900 K Street, Suite 110, Sacramento, Ca 95814","","","1/13/1992","Initiative","Qualified","Welfare.

Tax credit varies depending upon whether payment is for expenses or contributions, or on behalf of dependents or non-dependents. Maximum credit for payment of expenses on behalf of each dependent is $100 in 1988, increasing $200 each year until equals 25% of average annual cost per student in public schools. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: If adopted in November 1988, would result in unknown loss of state revenue, probably in excess of $100 million in 1988-89. This revenue loss would increase to several hundred million dollars in subsequent years as the maximum tax credit increases under the measure from $100 per student to an estimated $1,000 per student.

This fiscal effect may vary significantly, up or down, depending on the cost of insurance coverage for financial responsibility and motorists' reaction to the repeal. Department of Motor Vehicles would have a net revenue loss of about $1 million, accruing to the State Transportation Fund's Motor Vehicle Account.

For accidents occurring from November 9, 1988 to December 31, 1992, limits motor vehicle accident claims for non-economic losses such as pain and suffering to 25 percent of economic losses; prohibits contingent fees greater than 25 percent of economic losses.

Sets maximum rates for vehicle bodily injury and uninsured motorist insurance at 50% of insurer's premium in effect October 31, 1988 or rates of October 31, 1987, adjusted for inflation, whichever is lower. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local government: Unknown effect on state revenues derived from the gross premiums tax paid by insurance companies. Fiscal effect depends on how insurance companies and consumers react to the measure's rate reductions. If supply and demand stay the same, it is estimated that state general fund revenues from the gross premiums tax could be reduced by about $70 million in 1988-89 (partial year) and $120 million in 1989-90 (first full year). If insurance companies increase other rates to compensate for the rate reductions, the revenue loss could be less. Also, the adoption would increase state administrative costs by about $2 million in the first year and about $1 million annually thereafter.

Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: The net fiscal effect of raising the monetary limit on the courts is unknown because of uncertainties over the extent to which the added costs of increased filings in small claims courts will be offset by the savings of decreased filings in the municipal and justice courts. It also would result in an unknown net loss of revenue to the state and an unknown increase in revenues to counties primarily due to changes in the amount of filing fees that will be generated and the dedication of filing fees for the specific local program of providing small claims advisory services.","http://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1609&context=ca_ballot_inits","Honorable Richard Polanco Assemblyman, State Capitol, Sacramento, California 95814","","(916) 445-7587","2/18/1988","Initiative","Failed to Qualify","Motor Vehicle Accident Claims And Insurance Regulation.

INITIATIVE STATUTE. Amends State Constitution by establishing a minimum level of state funding for school and community college districts; transferring to such districts, within limits, state revenues in excess of State's appropriations limit; and exempting excess funds from appropriations limit. Adds provisions to Education Code requiring excess funds to be used solely for instructional improvement and accountability and requiring schools to report student achievement, drop-out rates, expenditures per student, progress toward reducing class size and teaching loads, classroom discipline, curriculum, quality of teaching, and other school matters. Contains other provisions. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: The measure requires allocation of excess tax revenue when available, up to a maximum of 4% of the minimum support level for local education agencies. Since the measure allows the expenditure of excess tax revenue that might otherwise be returned to taxpayers, it may reduce or eliminate any future tax rebate. The requirement for a minimum level of funding for local education will result in a minimum additional state cost of approximately $100 million in 1988-89. If state revenues increase by more than 5 percent, the state cost in 1988-89 is estimated to be $100 million plus approximately $100 million for every percentage point in revenue growth above 5 percent. The amount of revenues in excess of the state appropriations limit, if any, which may be transferred to local education agencies in 1988-89 and the related adjustments in minimum levels of support is currently indeterminable. It is estimated that the State Department of Education will incur $300,000 in costs to prepare a statewide model School Accountability Report Card and that the total costs to local school districts to develop and issue their respective school report cards would range between $2 million and $7 million.","http://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1596&context=ca_ballot_inits","Ed Foglia, President California Teachers Association, P.O.

Limits administrative expenses. Initially, Franchise Tax Board to solicit contributions for fund. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: The tax credit will result in state general fund losses, probably several million dollars annually, and larger revenue gains to the AIDS Research Trust Fund from 1988-89 and continuing through 1991-92. The Franchise Tax Board and the AIDS Research Trust Board will incur unknown administrative costs, likely in excess of several hundred thousand dollars annually, to administer the measure's program. In addition, the Franchise Tax Board will incur costs to administer the tax credit program which is estimated to be about $250,000 in the start-up year 1988-89, and probably less than $100,000 annually in 1989-90 through 1991-92 depending on taxpayer participation. The trust fund would finance administrative costs up to the measure's 6 percent cap on administrative expenses. Any additional costs would be financed by the state general fund.

In short run, a multi-million dollar net decrease in state General Fund revenues due to loss of tax revenues. Long term effect unknown. 3. State General Fund savings of approximately $45 million annually resulting from transfer of costs of hearings to a new surcharge on workers' compensation insurance premiums.

APPROPRIATION LIMIT CHANGE. CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. Requires 3 percent of total state General Fund budget be included in reserve for emergencies and economic uncertainties. Provides that net revenues derived from state sales and use taxes on motor vehicle fuels shall be used only for public streets, highways, and mass transit guideways. (Three year phase-in.) Requires 2/3 vote of Legislature or majority vote of voters before taxes on motor vehicle fuels may be raised. Reserve and fuel tax revenues excluded from appropriation limit. Prohibits Legislature from lowering local sales tax rates in effect January 1, 1987. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: The sales tax and transportation-related revenue provisions of this measure would result in a net increase in the state's appropriations authority of at least $690 million in 1988-89, $630 million in 1989-90, $575 million in 1990-91, $525 million in 1991-92, and decreasing amounts annually thereafter. The provisions of this measure related to reserve funds could result in an additional increase of state appropriations authority of up to $700 million in 1988-89, $815 million in 1989-90, $865 million in 1990-91, and $915 million in 1991-92. Thus, assuming sufficient levels of revenue, the state could make additional appropriations of approximately $1.4 billion in 1991-92, when the provisions are fully phased-in. The measure would also result in revenue losses to the General Fund and revenue gains for transportation-related programs of approximately $710 million in 1991-92, after the measure is fully phased-in. To the extent that state revenues are sufficient, the increased appropriations authority mentioned above could partially or fully offset the General Fund revenue losses resulting from the transportation-related provisions of this measure. Finally, the measure could have the effect of reducing the amount of surplus state revenues which would otherwise have to be returned to taxpayers in future years.","http://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1572&context=ca_ballot_inits","Paul Gann, 2512 Los Feliz, Carmichael, California 95608 (916) 482-6175; Joel Fox, 6600 Balcom Avenue, Reseda, California 91335 (Attorney For Proponents); Steven G.

Instead, provides that reapportionment for such districts shall take place in the year following every other presidential election, commencing in 1989, and that districts shall be reasonably equal based on the number of registered voters within such districts.

Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: The state Supreme Court has ruled that the State Constitution does not permit reapportionment by statutory initiative. Thus, this statutory initiative, by itself, would have no fiscal effect. A companion initiative is being proposed to amend the State Constitution to permit reapportionment by initiative statute and to establish requirements for the composition of legislative districts. If the companion initiative is approved at the June 1986 Primary Election, that initiative (rather than this statutory initiative) would compel the state to reapportion the existing Senate and/or Assembly districts, or if this initiative statute is approved, compel the state to conform to the boundary lines established by this initiative statute. In either event, approval of this constitutional amendment would compel the state to conduct a second Primary Election, prior to the General Election in November 1986, to conform the requirement imposed by the Constitutional Amendment that each Senate District encompass two entire Assembly Districts. The second Primary Election would be necessary to select party nominees from the newly drawn districts prior to the November 1986 election.

"SA83RF0034","","346","Agricultural Labor-Management Relations Act.","AGRICULTURAL LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS ACT. INITIATIVE STATUTE. Repeals present Agricultural Labor Relations Act (ALRA). Enacts new ALMRA statute, which changes manner in which agricultural labor relations are regulated. Measure's stated purpose---to conform the state act to the federal National Labor Relations Act, providing that specified federal precedents be followed in judicial and administrative interpretations. Changes from current law include, among others, allowing ALMRB discretion in timing employee representation elections, defining labor contractors as employers, limiting secondary boycotts, limiting make whole remedy against employers, redefining union membership obligation requirements, and modifying administrative and other procedures used. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: At present, the state spends approximately $7 million to administer the provisions of the ALRA. This initiative would increase these costs, based on provisions which require the Agricultural Labor Relations Board to: (1) Determine on a case-by-case basis that bargaining units are ""appropriate"" (Existing law establishes a single bargaining unit for all agricultural employees of an agricultural employer.); (2) Hold additional elections--at the request of not less than 30 percent of the affected workers--to rescind organizational security arrangements that have been negotiated by the union and the employer (There are currently no such elections under the ALRA.); and (3) Investigate and prosecute additional unfair labor practice charges in cases where unions are accused of violating the initiative's more restrictive secondary boycott language. The initiative also has provisions which would result in decreased costs. For example, a provision eliminating the need to hold hearings to determine the proper penalties for make whole remedies in cases where employers fail to bargain in good faith would reduce workload and costs. Overall, the increased costs of the initiative would probably exceed savings, by an unknown amount, primarily because of the major revisions of the ALRA election procedures.","http://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1511&context=ca_ballot_inits","James Wiley Nielsen, 1742 Brown Avenue, Woodland, Ca 95695","","(916) 445-3353","1/25/1984","Initiative","Failed to Qualify","Agricultural Labor-Management Relations Act.

Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: Assuming this measure is on the November 1984 ballot, it would earmark approximately $1.365 billion in revenues from sales taxes and personal income taxes to community college programs and services in 1985-86 and $1.490 billion in 1986-87.

Changes criminal court procedures regarding jury selection, continuances, admissible evidence, probation and parole revocation, grand juries, and other matters. Among other changes, provides agreement of 10 jurors is sufficient for criminal verdicts except in death penalty cases; authorizes hearsay evidence before grand jury or at preliminary examinations as basis for findings and restricts evidence presented to that needed to show sufficient cause to believe defendant committed an offense; expands judicial control of jury examination; requires showing of good cause for continuances; restricts motions made prior to or at preliminary examinations. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: The various provisions of this measure could affect the length and number of criminal proceedings (grand jury hearings, preliminary hearings, and trials) and the length of incarceration of defendants for whom probation or parole is revoked. Some of these changes probably would result in savings to state and local governments, especially those relating to non-unanimous jury verdicts, and the jury selection process. Other provisions, particularly those involving probation and parole revocation, could result in additional costs to state and local governments.

Establishes Public Gaming Control Commission to issue permits and exercise other powers pursuant to laws enacted by legislature.

Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: There would be an indeterminate increase in state costs for regulation of the proposed gaming and lotteries. Also, an indeterminate, but potentially substantial increase in state revenues resulting from the permit fees for gaming would result. All funds received by the state are committed to public education expenditures. Therefore, the administrative costs noted above would be borne by the General Fund. There would be an indeterminate increase in local costs for regulation of the proposed gaming and lotteries.

Amends constitution to: Prohibit legislative action on any bill but budget after May 31st, except for disaster relief, until budget bill is passed. Imposes pay and expense forfeitures, personal fines, if Legislature violates June 15th constitutional budget deadline. Continues current year budget into new fiscal year and enacts Governor's Budget, at reduced spending levels, if no budget bill by July 15th. Limits legislator personal expense allowances to one-half annual salary, and requires voter approval of increases in salary or expense allowance. Adds other provisions. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: The measure's provisions relating to legislators' compensation would have an indeterminable impact on the state General Fund in future years. Such costs could increase or decrease depending on the level of compensation which the voters approve for legislators. Costs, however, would decrease to the extent that legislators' expense allowances are reduced as a result of being limited to one-half of their annual salary. Finally, revenues could increase if, as a result of the measure, legislators are required to pay more state income tax on reimbursements they receive. We estimate that if the Legislature fails to pass a budget by the June 15 deadline specified in this measure, for each day until a budget bill is passed, there would be about $21,000 of General Fund savings from legislators not being compensated and $24,000 of revenues from fines imposed on the members.

Amends Article XIIIA, enacted as Proposition 13 in 1978, by adding additional restrictions on real property taxation and on enactment of new tax measures. Designates various effective dates for provisions. Prohibits imposition of any new tax based upon real property ownership, sale, or lease. Prohibits adoption of measures which increase any tax on any taxpayer except upon two-thirds vote of Legislature for state taxes and two-thirds vote of electorate for other governmental entities. Provides for specified refunds including refunds of real property taxes attributable to assessed value inflation adjustments in assessment years 1975-76, 1976-77, 1977-78. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: There will be both one time and ongoing fiscal effects. One time fiscal effects: (1) If pending litigation does not change current assessment practices, there will be a potential cost of approximately $1.15 billion to pay property tax refunds. These would be paid by the state ($420 million), local property taxpayers through higher levies for debt service (up to $140 million), and local governments ($590 million). If pending litigation overturns current assessment practices, the cost of refunds payable would not be attributable to this measure, but there will be a cost of $250 million to pay higher interest on the refunds. (2) The state will gain either $60 million or $13 million in increased state income tax revenues because the property tax refunds paid or higher interest will be taxable income. Ongoing fiscal effects: If pending litigation does not change current assessment practices: (1) There will be revenue losses of $54 million to local governments and $30 million to school districts. (2) There will be an unknown but probably major gain in state income tax revenues. (3) There will be unknown multimillion dollar costs and revenue losses to state and local governments due to tax rate limitations; assessments practices changes; voting requirements for tax legislation; and the definitions of taxes, fees, and assessments contained in the measure.

Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: This initiative would result in an increase in the cigarette excise tax of $5.6 million in 1984-85 and $13.5 million annually thereafter. The cost of the Tobacco Education Project would depend on the scope of the project's advertising campaign. Over the long run, these costs would not exceed the amount of money available from the new cigarette tax.
