Initiative Statute.","For workers providing home care services to the elderly, blind, and disabled pursuant to the state In-Home Supportive Services program, adds an amount to their hourly wage equal to any increase in the state minimum wage. Requires these workers to receive
75 hours of training in subjects such as personal care, disease management, diet, nutrition, physical activities, workplace safety, and consumer and provider roles and rights. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local government:State costs upwards of $600 million annually associated with the measure's requirements to pay a wage supplement and provide paid training to In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) providers, with costs growing with any future increases in the state-mandated hourly minimum wage. Potential state savings–not likely to exceed the low tens of millions of dollars annually–from reduced public assistance utilization by IHSS providers and a potential reduction in higher-cost publicly funded health care.(13-0052.)(Full Text)","Chris Salm and Malik Bennett c/o Lance Olson","","(916) 442-2952","01/31/14","Signatures Required","07/10/2014","504,760"
